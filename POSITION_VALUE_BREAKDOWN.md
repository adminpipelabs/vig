## Key Insight

**We ARE up on the 12PM markets!** The positions are profitable but:
1. They're marked as "won" in the database
2. But the shares haven't been redeemed to cash
3. So the $93.76 position value includes these winning positions

**The issue:** Won positions need to be redeemed to convert shares to cash. Until then, they show as "position value" but aren't available as cash.

## Next Steps

1. **Redeem the 12PM winning positions** (they're already resolved)
2. **Settle the 5 pending bets** (check if they've resolved)
3. **Redeem all other won positions** to convert to cash

The $93.76 isn't lost - it's winning positions that need redemption!
